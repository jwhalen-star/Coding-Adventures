Welcome to my selection sort folder.
A selection sort is a type of sorting algorithm that starts with the first element in a list as the current position, and swaps this element with the smallest or largest element in the list before moving on to the next element. 
All elements to the left of the current element are considered sorted and ignored. The algorithm scans the remaining unsorted portion of the list to find the next correct element to place. This process continues until the entire list is sorted.
Useful for when memory is extremely limited, and when the list is small and performance isn't critical.
