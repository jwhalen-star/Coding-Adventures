# My-Coding-and-Pseudocode-Repo

Welcome to the "My Coding and Pseudocode Projects Repo" repository. 
Within this repository you will find structured pseudocode representations of programming solutions, flowcharts, and of course, actual code I have written in various programming languages in which I explore fundamental syntax and coding concepts. 
Furthermore, each implementation is designed to showcase a deep and fulfilled understanding of the strategies being applied, as well as clearly documents the problem-solving journey embedded within this repository. 
All code is custom written, and each coding challenge is inspired by classic programming exercises, which have been uniquely reimagined and presented here.
