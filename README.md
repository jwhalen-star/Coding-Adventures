# My-Projects

Welcome to the "My coding and pseudocode projects" repository. 
Within this repository you will find structured pseudocode representations of programming solutions, flowcharts, and of course, actual code I have written in various programming languages in which I explore fundamental syntax and coding concepts. 
Furthermore, each implementation is designed to showcase a deep and fulfilled understanding of the questions being asked and the strategies being applied, as well as clearly documents the problem-solving journey embedded within this repository. 
All code is my own original work, and each coding challenge is inspired by classic programming exercises, which have been uniquely reimagined and presented here.
