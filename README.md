# My-Projects

Welcome to my coding and pseudocode projects repository. 
Please find within this repository structured pseudocode representations of programming solutions, flowcharts, and of course, actual code I have written in various programming languages in which I explore fundamental syntax and coding concepts. 
Furthermore, each implementation is designed to showcase a deep and fulfilled understanding of the strategies being applied, along with clearly documenting the problem-solving journey embedded within this repository. 
All code is my own original work, and each coding challenge is inspired by classic programming exercises, which have been uniquely reimagined and presented here.
