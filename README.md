# My-Projects

Welcome to my coding and pseudocode projects repository. Inside, you’ll find structured pseudocode representations of programming solutions, flowcharts, and, of course, actual code I’ve written in various programming languages. I explore fundamental syntax and coding concepts in each language. Each implementation is crafted to demonstrate a thorough understanding of the underlying strategies being implemented, while clearly documenting the problem-solving journey embedded within this repository. All code is my own original work, and each project is inspired by classic programming challenges, uniquely reimagined and presented here.
