# My-Projects

Welcome to my coding/pseudocode projects repository.
Please find within this repository structured pseudocode representations of programming solutions, flowcharts, and of course, actual code in various coding languages. 
I explore fundamental coding concepts including but not limited to control flow and object oriented programming. 
Each implementation is designed to showcase a deep and fulfilled understanding of the strategies being applied, along with clearly documenting the problem-solving journey embedded within this repository.
All coding is my own original work, and every problem is inspired by classic programming challenges uniquely presented within this repository.
