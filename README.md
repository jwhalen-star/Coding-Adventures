# My-Projects

Welcome to my coding/pseudocode projects repository.
Please find within this repository structured pseudocode representations of programming solutions, flowcharts, and of course, actual code I have written in various programming languages. 
I explore fundamental syntax and coding concepts in each language. 
Furthermore, each implementation is designed to showcase a deep and fulfilled understanding of the strategies being applied, along with clearly documenting the problem-solving journey embedded within this repository.
All code is my own original work, and every problem is inspired by classic programming exercises uniquely presented within this repository.
