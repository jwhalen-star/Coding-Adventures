# my-projects

Welcome to my coding/pseudocode projects repository.
Please find within this repository structured pseudocode representations of programming solutions, flowcharts, and of course, actual code. 
I explore fundamental coding concepts including but not limited to control flow and object oriented programming. 
Each implementation is designed to showcase a deep and fulfilled understanding of the strategies being applied. 
All coding is my own original work, and every problem is inspired by classic programming challenges uniquely presented within this repository. 

# Topics Covered

- Control Structures (if, loops)
- Functions and Recursion
- Arrays and Vectors
- Object-Oriented Programming
- File I/O
- Data Structures (stacks, queues, linked lists, etc.)
