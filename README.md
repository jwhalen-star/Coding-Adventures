# My-Projects

Welcome to my coding/pseudocode projects repository.
Please find within this repository structured pseudocode representations of programming solutions, flowcharts, and of course, actual code. 
I explore fundamental coding concepts including but not limited to control flow and object oriented programming. 
Each implementation is designed to showcase a deep and fulfilled understanding of the strategies being applied with a strong emphasis on clearly documenting the thought process and logic behind every solution.
All coding is my own original work, and every problem is inspired by classic programming challenges uniquely presented within this repository.
